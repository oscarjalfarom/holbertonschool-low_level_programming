C Programming Concepts
Welcome to my C programming repository! In this directory, I have learned the following key concepts through various projects:

The awesomeness of C programming.
C's inventor: Dennis Ritchie.
Notable figures: Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
What happens when you type gcc main.c.
Understanding the entry point and the main function.
Printing text with printf, puts, and putchar.
Using sizeof to get the size of a specific type.
Compiling with gcc and the default program name.
The official C coding style and using betty-style.
Finding the right header to include for standard library functions.
The influence of the main function on the program's return value.
Feel free to explore the code and projects in this repository to deepen your understanding of C programming. Happy coding!
